The original csv that held the data was too large to upload through the GUI.
I did not know how to upload it throught the command line at that moment, so I split it into two csv files.
The script that generates the data should be included. 
The files here are meant to be run on google colab using gpu.
It takes around 30 minutes for google colab to download the necessary libraries.
